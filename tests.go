// Kubernetes
// If receiver/any node crashes, still received message?
// If high load, autoscale multiple pods

// Rabbitmq
// If receiver crashes, message is kept in queue until receiver is back up
// If queue is full, scales another queue
// If queue crashes, messages are not lost

// Terraform
// Is free/how much is this in gcp?

// Redis
